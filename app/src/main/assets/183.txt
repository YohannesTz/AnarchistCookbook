                             ANARCHY 'N' EXPLOSIVES
                               VOLUME 5 -- 4/3/89

     Well, hasn't it been long since Volume 4 of Anarchy 'n' Explosives?
Well, I finally got around to typing up another volume. This one will be
dedicated to the extremely simple and more accessible explosives and
incendiaries to be prepared at home, or laboratory; depending upon the
environment you have access to or are accustomed to.

     Anyway, getting back down to business, I must (again), put up this sign:

         WARNING: THESE EXPLOSIVES/INCENDIARIES ARE REAL, NOT TOYS. USE
          EXTREME CAUTION WHEN PREPARING AND APPLYING WHEN APPLICABLE.
                 FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH.
                              USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

          Enough  of the warnings and notes; for further information and/or
     comments  on  this  series  of  ever popular explosives, contact me (I
     don't  sign  these  "publications") on the Knavery BBS at xxx-xxx-xxxx
     on  the  public message base, I should be reading some requests if you
     leave  them.  And,  volume  number 6 should be coming out sooner than
     the time between 4 and 5, but don't count on it.

BULK POWDERS:
=============

      Bulk  powders are types of gunpowders consisting of nitrocellulose and a
mixture  of  other chemically explosive solutions. These nitrocellulose fibers
are  stuck together, but are not completely collided. Some contain little else
but  nitrocellulose;  others  contain,  in  addition  to  potassium and barium
nitrates,  camphor, vaseline, paraffin, lampblack, starch, dextrine, potassium
dichromate  or  other  oxidizing  or  deterrent  salts,  and diphenylamine for
stabilization, and are colored in a variety of brilliant hues by means of col-
tar  dyes. Three typical bulk powders are made up according to the approximate
formulas tabulated below:

         Nitrocellulose........................ 84.0   87.0   89.0
           % N in nitrocellulose............... 13.2   12.9   12.9
         Potassium nitrate.....................  7.5    6.0    6.0
         Barium nitrate........................  7.5    2.0    3.0
         Starch................................  -.-    -.-    1.0
         Paraffin oil..........................  -.-    4.0    -.-
         Diphenylamine.........................  1.0    1.0    1.0

      The  mixture  is  mixed  in warm water and dried thoroughly. Then either
granulated  or  made  into powder by crushing with a wooden block and screened
through  a  12-mesh sieve. The material is then stored in a moisture-resistant
container for future or immediate use.

MERCURY FULMINATE:
==================
      Mercury  fulminate  is  an  initiating  explosive, commonly appearing as
white  or  gray  crystals.  It  is  extremely sensitive to initiation by heat,
friction,  spark  or  flame, and impact. It detonates when initiated by any of
these  means.  It  is pressed into containers, usually at 3000 psi, for use in
detonators  and blasting caps. However, when compressed at greater and greater
pressure  (up to 30,000 psi), it becomes "dead pressed." In this condition, it
can  only  be detonated by another initial detonating agent. Mercury fulminate
gradually  becomes inert when stored continuously above 100 degrees F. A dark-
colored  product  of  deterioration  gives  evidence  of  this effect. Mercury exfulminate  is  stored underwater except when there is danger of freezing. Then
it is stored under a mixture of water and alcohol.

     Preparation  of  Mercury  Fulminate. Five grams of mercury is addedExt55 
cc.  of nitric acid (specific gravity 1.42) in a 100-cc. Erlenmeyer flask, and
the  mixture  is  allowed  to stand without shaking until the mercury has gone
into  solution. The acid liquid is then poured into 50 cc. of 90% alcohol in a
500-cc.  beaker  in the hood. The temperature of the mixture rises, a vigorous
reaction  commences,  white  fumes  come  off,  and cdata  bstals of fulminate soon
begin  to precipitate. Red fumes appear and the precipitation of the fulminate
becomes  more  rapid,  then white fumes again as the reaction moderates. After
about  20  minutes, the reaction is over; water is added, and the cdata  bstals are
washed  with  water repeatedly by decantation until the washings are no longer
acid   to  litmus.  The  product  consists  of  grayish-yellow  cdata  bstals,  and
corresponds  to a good grade of commercial fulminate. It may be obtained white
and  entirely  pure  by  dissolving  in  strong  ammonia water, filtering, and
reprecipitating  by  the  addition  of  30% acetic acid. The pure fulminate is
filtered  off,  washed  several times with cold water, and stored under water,
or,  if  a very small amount is desired for experimental purposes, it is dried
in a desiccator.

AMATOL:
=======

      Description:  amatol is a high explosive, whit to buff in color. It is a
mixture  of  ammonium  nitrate and TNT, with a relative effectiveness slightly
higher  than  that  of  TNT  alone. Common compositions vary from 80% ammonium
nitrate  and  20%  TNT  to 40% ammonium nitrate and 60% TNT. Amatol is used as
the  main  bursting  charge  in  artillery  shells  and  bombs. Amatol absorbs
moisture  and  can  form dangerous compounds with copper and brass. Therefore,
it should not be housed in containers of such metals.

BLACK POWDERS:
==============

      Black  powders  burn  either  quickly  or  very  slowly depending on the
composition  of  such  a  mixture; however, these powders produce smoke, often
great  amounts,  and  is most useful in applications where smoke is no object.
It  is  the  best for communicating fire and for producing a quick, hot flame.
Black  powder  is  used  in  both  propellant  charges for shrapnel shells, in
saluting  and  blank  fire  charges, as the bursting charge of practice shells
and  bombs,  as a propelling charge in certain pyrotechnic pieces, and, either
with  or  without  the  admixture of other substances which modify the rate of
burning,  in the time-train rings and in other parts of fuses. Below is a list
of black powders and their compositions.
